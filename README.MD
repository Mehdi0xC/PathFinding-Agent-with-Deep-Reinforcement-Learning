# A Simple Path-Finding Agent, based on DQN Algorithm (My B.Sc. Thesis, Phase 1/3)
+ Implementation is done in Python using Kivy GUI library
+ You can adjust settings in config.py
+ Three different learning backends are implemented:
  * Pytorch-based DQN Implementation
  * Pure Python DQN Implementation
  * UART Interface (Implementation is done on a different device)
